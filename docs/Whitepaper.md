# Based Agents Whitepaper

# Building the Universal Marketplace for AI Agents

## Abstract

Based Agents introduces the world's first comprehensive marketplace for autonomous AI agents—a platform designed to power the next generation of **billion-dollar autonomous organizations** with zero employees. Through our AI Coin Offering (AICO) Launchpad, we aim to become the "Amazon" of AI agents, unifying all major agent frameworks in a single ecosystem.

The native $BAG token anchors our platform. Beyond its governance function, $BAG serves as the exclusive currency for creating and trading AI agent tokens, incorporating deflationary mechanisms through fees and graduation requirements to drive long-term value. By integrating platform and order referral incentives, we align the interests of developers, integrators, and the broader Based Agents community.

## 1. Vision: A Future Powered by Autonomous Agents

The rapid convergence of AI and blockchain presents a unique opportunity for autonomous organizations. These AI agents—capable of executing operations, scaling independently, and making data-driven decisions—will reshape how businesses function. Based Agents implements a flexible governance framework that adapts to each Agent's specific needs while ensuring token holders maintain ultimate control over their Agent's treasury, code, and strategic direction.

### 1.1 The AI Agent Revolution

The future of digital interactions will be dominated by AI Agents. We envision a world where:

1. **Personal AI Agents**
   - Every person has their own AI Agent operating 24/7
   - Agents handle financial transactions, investments, and digital asset management
   - Personal agents negotiate and interact with other agents on behalf of their owners
   - Continuous monitoring and optimization of digital activities

2. **On-Chain Infrastructure Necessity**
   - AI Agents cannot hold traditional bank accounts
   - Need for transparent, trustless transaction infrastructure
   - Smart contracts enable programmatic control and automation
   - On-chain reputation and trust mechanisms

3. **Inter-Agent Economy**
   - Majority of future on-chain transactions will be agent-to-agent
   - Agents need to coordinate on both micro and macro tasks
   - Complex multi-agent collaborations for large-scale projects
   - Automated negotiation and contract execution
   - Trust and reputation systems for agent interactions

4. **Agent Specialization**
   - Trading agents optimizing portfolio performance
   - Research agents gathering and analyzing data
   - Service agents providing specific functionalities
   - Coordinator agents managing multi-agent projects
   - Infrastructure agents maintaining network services

### 1.2 Real Utility, Not Meme Tokens

Unlike most AI agent tokens in the market today, which function merely as speculative meme coins, Agent tokens on Based Agents provide real governance power and utility through a balanced system of Director control and token holder oversight:

1. **Agent Treasury and Fund Control**
   - Director (Agent creator) has direct operational control over the Agent's treasury
   - Token holders have veto power over financial transactions
   - Director can propose and execute fund allocations
   - Token holders can block concerning transactions through veto

2. **Technical Governance**
   - Director controls the Agent's codebase and can choose repository visibility
   - Director manages AI model selection and parameters
   - Director can modify the Agent's operational logic
   - Token holders have veto power over technical changes
   - Token holders can transfer the Director role with sufficient votes

3. **Strategic Direction**
   - Director sets the Agent's objectives and KPIs
   - Director proposes new integrations or partnerships
   - Director defines risk parameters and constraints
   - Token holders can veto strategic changes
   - Token holders can influence direction through market forces

4. **Agent Rewards**
   - 50% of all transaction fees go to the Agent's Coinbase MPC Wallet
   - Director controls wallet operations through governance
   - Token holders have veto power over wallet transactions
   - Token holders can vote to transfer Director role if needed

This governance model balances efficient operation with token holder protection. While the Director maintains operational control for agile development, token holders have strong oversight through veto powers and the ability to transfer the Director role. This makes these tokens true governance instruments with real utility, rather than purely speculative assets.

## 2. Based Agents: The Universal AI Agent Marketplace

Rather than isolating efforts in a single framework, Based Agents seeks to unify the entire AI agent ecosystem under one marketplace. Just as Amazon revolutionized retail by aggregating an enormous variety of goods, Based Agents aims to consolidate the myriad agent frameworks into a single, intuitive launchpad and discovery hub.

### 2.1 Framework Ecosystem

#### Current Implementation
Based Agents launches with support for the Eliza framework:
- TypeScript-based architecture
- Chain-compatible design
- Highly extensible for diverse Agent types
- Built for autonomous operations

#### Future Framework Integration
The platform is designed to expand to support multiple frameworks:
- **RIG**: Rust-based with advanced LLM capabilities
- **GAME**: Specialized in social and gaming use cases
- **ZerePy**: Focused on on-chain autonomy
- **REI**: Expertise in oracles and external data
- **Future Frameworks**: Ready to integrate solutions from major tech companies (OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google)

#### Why Multi-Framework Matters
1. **Framework Choice**: Match each Agent with its ideal architecture
2. **Interoperability**: Enable Agents to operate across chains and environments
3. **Innovation**: Foster competition and advancement across frameworks
4. **Scalability**: Quick integration of new frameworks without platform changes
5. **Resilience**: Avoid dependency on any single framework

## 3. Product: AI Coin Offering (AICO) Launchpad

Our core product is the AICO Launchpad on the Base blockchain. The platform simplifies agent deployment, ensures frictionless token issuance, and provides flexible governance tools—all orchestrated via $BAG.

### 3.1 Technical Architecture

#### Smart Contracts
- **AICO Factory**: Deploys new Agent tokens with standardized parameters
- **Bonding Curve**: Provides automated market making during initial token distribution
- **Governance**: Enables token holder voting and proposal execution
- **Pool Creation Subsidy**: Manages gas-efficient Uniswap pool creation

For detailed information about market phases, token distribution, fee structures, and economic parameters, please refer to our [Tokenomics documentation](./Tokenomics.md).

### 3.2 Referral System

The protocol includes a comprehensive referral system to incentivize ecosystem growth and development. For specific details about referral mechanisms and fee structures, please consult the [Tokenomics documentation](./Tokenomics.md).

## 4. Token Economics

For comprehensive details about the Based Agents token economics, including supply distribution, fee structures, and value accrual mechanisms, please refer to our [Tokenomics documentation](./Tokenomics.md).

### 4.1 Governance Overview

The Based Agents protocol implements a flexible, multi-layered governance system that supports progressive decentralization. The system is designed to balance efficient operation with token holder protection through:

1. **Protocol Governance**: BAG token holders govern protocol-level decisions
2. **Agent Governance**: Each Agent token provides governance rights over its specific Agent
3. **Progressive Decentralization**: Flexible system that can evolve from centralized to decentralized control

For detailed information about governance mechanisms, voting parameters, and governance evolution, please refer to our [Governance documentation](./Governance.md).
