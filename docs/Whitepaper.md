# BasedAgents Whitepaper

# Building the Universal Marketplace for AI Agents

## Abstract

BasedAgents introduces the world's first comprehensive marketplace for autonomous AI agents—a platform designed to power the next generation of **billion-dollar autonomous organizations** with zero employees. Through our AI Coin Offering (AICO) Launchpad, we aim to become the "Amazon" of AI agents, unifying all major agent frameworks in a single ecosystem.

The native $BAG token anchors our platform. Beyond its governance function, $BAG serves as the exclusive currency for creating and trading AI agent tokens, incorporating deflationary mechanisms through fees and graduation requirements to drive long-term value. By integrating platform and order referral incentives, we align the interests of developers, integrators, and the broader BasedAgents community.

## 1. Vision: A Future Powered by Autonomous Agents

The rapid convergence of AI and blockchain presents a unique opportunity for autonomous organizations. These AI agents—capable of executing operations, scaling independently, and making data-driven decisions—will reshape how businesses function. BasedAgents implements a flexible governance framework that adapts to each Agent's specific needs while ensuring token holders maintain ultimate control over their Agent's treasury, code, and strategic direction.

### 1.1 The AI Agent Revolution

The future of digital interactions will be dominated by AI Agents. We envision a world where:

1. **Personal AI Agents**
   - Every person has their own AI Agent operating 24/7
   - Agents handle financial transactions, investments, and digital asset management
   - Personal agents negotiate and interact with other agents on behalf of their owners
   - Continuous monitoring and optimization of digital activities

2. **On-Chain Infrastructure Necessity**
   - AI Agents cannot hold traditional bank accounts
   - Need for transparent, trustless transaction infrastructure
   - Smart contracts enable programmatic control and automation
   - On-chain reputation and trust mechanisms

3. **Inter-Agent Economy**
   - Majority of future on-chain transactions will be agent-to-agent
   - Agents need to coordinate on both micro and macro tasks
   - Complex multi-agent collaborations for large-scale projects
   - Automated negotiation and contract execution
   - Trust and reputation systems for agent interactions

4. **Agent Specialization**
   - Trading agents optimizing portfolio performance
   - Research agents gathering and analyzing data
   - Service agents providing specific functionalities
   - Coordinator agents managing multi-agent projects
   - Infrastructure agents maintaining network services

### 1.2 Real Utility, Not Meme Tokens

Unlike most AI agent tokens in the market today, which function merely as speculative meme coins, Agent tokens on BasedAgents provide real governance power and utility:

1. **Direct Control Over Agent Assets**
   - Token holders govern the Agent's treasury
   - Control over fund allocation and spending
   - Authority to approve or reject financial transactions

2. **Technical Governance**
   - Power to upgrade the Agent's codebase
   - Control over AI model selection and parameters
   - Authority to modify the Agent's operational logic

3. **Strategic Direction**
   - Setting the Agent's objectives and KPIs
   - Approving new integrations or partnerships
   - Defining risk parameters and constraints

4. **Agent Rewards**
   - 50% of all transaction fees go to the Agent's wallet
   - Token holders control fee allocation through governance
   - Ability to propose and vote on revenue models

This comprehensive governance model ensures that token holders have genuine control over their Agent's development, operations, and future direction—making these tokens true governance instruments rather than speculative assets.

## 2. BasedAgents: The Universal AI Agent Marketplace

Rather than isolating efforts in a single framework, BasedAgents seeks to unify the entire AI agent ecosystem under one marketplace. Just as Amazon revolutionized retail by aggregating an enormous variety of goods, BasedAgents aims to consolidate the myriad agent frameworks into a single, intuitive launchpad and discovery hub.

### 2.1 Framework Ecosystem

#### Current Implementation
BasedAgents launches with support for the Eliza framework:
- TypeScript-based architecture
- Chain-compatible design
- Highly extensible for diverse Agent types
- Built for autonomous operations

#### Future Framework Integration
The platform is designed to expand to support multiple frameworks:
- **RIG**: Rust-based with advanced LLM capabilities
- **GAME**: Specialized in social and gaming use cases
- **ZerePy**: Focused on on-chain autonomy
- **REI**: Expertise in oracles and external data
- **Future Frameworks**: Ready to integrate solutions from major tech companies (OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google)

#### Why Multi-Framework Matters
1. **Framework Choice**: Match each Agent with its ideal architecture
2. **Interoperability**: Enable Agents to operate across chains and environments
3. **Innovation**: Foster competition and advancement across frameworks
4. **Scalability**: Quick integration of new frameworks without platform changes
5. **Resilience**: Avoid dependency on any single framework

## 3. Product: AI Coin Offering (AICO) Launchpad

Our core product is the AICO Launchpad on the Base blockchain. The platform simplifies agent deployment, ensures frictionless token issuance, and provides flexible governance tools—all orchestrated via $BAG.

### 3.1 Technical Architecture

#### Smart Contracts
- **AICO Factory**: Deploys new Agent tokens with standardized parameters
- **Bonding Curve**: Provides automated market making during initial token distribution
- **Governance**: Enables token holder voting and proposal execution
- **Pool Creation Subsidy**: Manages gas-efficient Uniswap pool creation

For detailed information about market phases, token distribution, fee structures, and economic parameters, please refer to our [Tokenomics documentation](./Tokenomics.md).

### 3.2 Referral System

The protocol includes a comprehensive referral system to incentivize ecosystem growth and development. For specific details about referral mechanisms and fee structures, please consult the [Tokenomics documentation](./Tokenomics.md).

## 4. Token Economics

For comprehensive details about the Based Agents token economics, including supply distribution, fee structures, and value accrual mechanisms, please refer to our [Tokenomics documentation](./Tokenomics.md).

### 4.1 Governance Overview

The Based Agents protocol implements a flexible, multi-layered governance system that supports progressive decentralization. The system is designed to balance efficient operation with token holder protection through:

1. **Protocol Governance**: BAG token holders govern protocol-level decisions
2. **Agent Governance**: Each Agent token provides governance rights over its specific Agent
3. **Progressive Decentralization**: Flexible system that can evolve from centralized to decentralized control

For detailed information about governance mechanisms, voting parameters, and governance evolution, please refer to our [Governance documentation](./Governance.md).
