# Sepolia Testnet Deployment v0.3

## Deployment Information
- **Script Used**: `scripts/AICOFlow.sepolia.deploy.js`
- **Total Deployment Cost**: 0.034 ETH (~$68 at current prices)
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and passed local tests using `test/AICOFlow.local.test.js`
- **Next Steps**: Run `test/AICOFlow.sepolia.test.js` and perform manual testing checklist below

## Contract Verification

### Verification Process
1. Automated verification using `scripts/verify.sepolia.js` for all logic contracts
2. Manual verification required for proxy contracts:
   - Visit each proxy contract on Etherscan
   - Click "More Options" -> "Is this a proxy?"
   - Click "Verify" to verify the proxy implementation
   - Confirm implementation contract is linked correctly

## Contract Verification Notes

### Special Case: Governor Proxy Verification
The Governor proxy contract at `0xC2b28e195ecB9d3d568Cb94FE9c0A960791e728a` required special handling for verification. This was because:

1. The initial verification attempt failed as the proxy contract needed explicit contract type specification
2. The proxy was created by the AICOFactory during AICO creation, making it different from other proxies deployed directly

The solution was to create a dedicated verification script ([scripts/verify-governor.js](../scripts/verify-governor.js)) that:
- Verifies the Governor Logic implementation
- Explicitly specifies the ERC1967 proxy contract type
- Provides the correct constructor arguments for the proxy

This script resolved the verification issue that wasn't caught by the main verification script because:
- The main script assumes standard proxy deployment patterns
- Factory-created proxies need explicit contract type specification
- The proxy's constructor arguments needed to be correctly specified

## Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Factory Verification & Initial Setup
Use this contract:
- AICOFactory Proxy: [0xe3a9C604E31197FB817077e01dB01a384B27BD5A](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe3a9C604E31197FB817077e01dB01a384B27BD5A#writeContract)

Tests:
- [ ] Verify factory points to correct implementations:
  1. Go to "Read Contract" tab
  2. Call `aicoLogic()` - should return: `0xB51EBf00B54C8a31ef5076F3D77A201637Bde963`
  3. Call `governorLogic()` - should return: `0x3c21c9bC638030AC0ea30ba76d00184d4940b265`

- [ ] Verify factory owner permissions:
  1. Go to "Read Contract" tab
  2. Call `owner()` - should return your deployer address: `0x82fED030C262ec0262624aaD0a17A0d1eDA24EA1`
  3. Go to "Write Contract" tab
  4. Try to call `setAICOLogic()` with a random address from a non-owner wallet - should revert
  5. Try to call `setGovernorLogic()` with a random address from a non-owner wallet - should revert
  6. Connect your owner wallet and try the same calls - should allow the transaction (but don't confirm it)
  7. Check `upgradeTo()` and `upgradeToAndCall()` have the same permission behavior

### 2. Agent Token Deployment & Management
Use these contracts:
- AICOFactory Proxy: [0xe3a9C604E31197FB817077e01dB01a384B27BD5A](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe3a9C604E31197FB817077e01dB01a384B27BD5A#writeContract)
- AICO Runtime: [0xBE93B86ca2f90D5408cF163151dfE0fD1fdcFBa1](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xBE93B86ca2f90D5408cF163151dfE0fD1fdcFBa1#writeContract)

Tests:
- [ ] Deploy new Agent token through Factory:
  1. Go to "Write as Proxy" tab on AICOFactory
  2. Call `createAICOWithGovernor` with these parameters:
     - `aicoInitData`: `0x077f224a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a000000000000000000000000082fed030c262ec0262624aad0a17a0d1eda24ea100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a54657374204167656e740000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004544553540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
       (This encodes: name="Test Agent", symbol="TEST", platformReferrer=deployer address)
     - `tokenCreator`: Your wallet address
     - `votingDelay`: `1` (1 block â‰ˆ 12 seconds)
     - `votingPeriod`: `50` (50 blocks â‰ˆ 10 minutes)
     - `proposalThreshold`: `0` (no minimum tokens needed to propose)

  Note: If you want to use different parameters, use the script at `scripts/encode-aico-init.js` to generate new encoded data.

- [ ] After deployment, verify the new token:
  1. Note the new AICO address from the deployment transaction
  2. Go to "Read Contract" tab on the new AICO and verify:
     - `name()` returns "Test Agent" (or your chosen name)
     - `symbol()` returns "TEST" (or your chosen symbol)
     - `decimals()` returns `18`
     - `totalSupply()` returns `300000000000000000000000000` (300M with 18 decimals)
     - `governor()` returns the new Governor address
     - `balanceOf(governor_address)` returns the full 300M supply

**Voting Parameters**:
- `votingDelay`: 1 block (~12 seconds) - Time between proposal creation and voting start
- `votingPeriod`: 50 blocks (~10 minutes) - Duration of voting period

These short periods are for testing purposes. On mainnet, these would typically be much longer (e.g., 1 day delay, 1 week voting period).

Tests:
- [ ] Check Governor's token balance (should be 300M)
- [ ] Create test proposal for a small transfer
- [ ] Vote on proposal
- [ ] Execute proposal after voting period
- [ ] Verify proposal execution succeeded
