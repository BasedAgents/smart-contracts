# Sepolia Testnet Deployment v0.3

## Deployment Information
- **Script Used**: `scripts/AICOFlow.sepolia.deploy.js`
- **Total Deployment Cost**: 0.034 ETH (~$68 at current prices)
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and passed local tests using `test/AICOFlow.local.test.js`
- **Next Steps**: Run `test/AICOFlow.sepolia.test.js` and perform manual testing checklist below

## Contract Verification

### Verification Process
1. Automated verification using `scripts/verify.sepolia.js` for all logic contracts
2. Manual verification required for proxy contracts:
   - Visit each proxy contract on Etherscan
   - Click "More Options" -> "Is this a proxy?"
   - Click "Verify" to verify the proxy implementation
   - Confirm implementation contract is linked correctly

## Contract Verification Notes

### Special Case: Governor Proxy Verification
The Governor proxy contract at `0xC2b28e195ecB9d3d568Cb94FE9c0A960791e728a` required special handling for verification. This was because:

1. The initial verification attempt failed as the proxy contract needed explicit contract type specification
2. The proxy was created by the AICOFactory during AICO creation, making it different from other proxies deployed directly

The solution was to create a dedicated verification script ([scripts/verify-governor.js](../scripts/verify-governor.js)) that:
- Verifies the Governor Logic implementation
- Explicitly specifies the ERC1967 proxy contract type
- Provides the correct constructor arguments for the proxy

This script resolved the verification issue that wasn't caught by the main verification script because:
- The main script assumes standard proxy deployment patterns
- Factory-created proxies need explicit contract type specification
- The proxy's constructor arguments needed to be correctly specified

### Notes
- All contract interactions can be done through Etherscan's "Write Contract" interface
- Keep track of transaction hashes and gas costs
- Document any unexpected behavior or deviations from expected results
- For large value transactions, always test with small amounts first
